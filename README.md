## Feature Extraction by Grammatical Evolution for One-Class Time Series Classification


Please use the file **feature_extraction.py** to run the algorithm, and so to extract features from your time series.

The file **run_a_feature_extractor.py** shows you how to transform your time series in a feature-based representation according to a given feature-extractor. Then, the file shows you how to evaluate classification performance in a one-class scenario.

Please refer to the paper for further information. Get in touch with me if necessary.


**Note:** This repository is basically a copy of [PonyGE2](https://github.com/PonyGE/PonyGE2) with a few adjustments to perform feature-extraction from time series as described in the related paper.
