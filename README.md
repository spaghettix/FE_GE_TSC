## Feature Extraction by Grammatical Evolution for One-Class Time Series Classification


Please use the file "feature_extraction.py" to run the algorithm, and so to extract features from your time series.

The file "run_a_feature_extractor.py" shows you how to transform your time series in a feature-based representation according to a given feature-extractor. Then, the file shows you how to evaluate classification performance in a one-class scenario.

Please refer to the paper further information. Get in touch with me if necessary.
